# Post_COVID-19_Vacation_Projection 

## Selected topic

•	Help travellers plan their next vacation by determining when countries will reach herd immunity based on their current vaccination rate. 

## Reason they selected the topic: 

•	COVID-19 has impacted many people around the world and many people are eager to travel. A major barrier to travelling right now is safety. Based on the current vaccination rates in each country we are going to determine when each country will reach herd immunity. Herd immunity is reached when approximately 70% of the population is fully vaccinated. 

## Description of the source of data: 

- Data is being used from Our World in Data for all countries but firstly to test our model, we will be using 3 countries. 
- Website: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations

## Questions they hope to answer with the data

## 1.1.0 Sketch It Out: Define Problem we plan to solve 
•	When will countries reach herd immunity for safe travelling? 

### 1.1.0 Project: Interactive website for Post covid19 Vacation Planner

•	Using Leaflet, mapping, and other tools to create visual representation of the results. 

•	Users will be able to input information

### 1.2.0 Key Queries for Planner 
#### 1.2.1 Safe Vacation country identifier: 

-	Safe vacation country identifier would be a country that has reached herd immunity. 

#### 1.2.2 Hot spots identifier around the world

-	To test our model: first we will focus on US, Isreal and UK, the countries that are doing good with vaccinating their population. 
-
