# Post COVID-19 Vacation Planner 

Your gateway to safe Travel

## Purpose 



The project aims to identify and forecast countries that will reach herd immunity by inducing the Arima model on the updated covid fully vaccinated data from our world. The model will evaluate and forecast the future data based on the past and present vaccination rate.

The herd immunity is reached when 70% of the population are fully vaccinated with both the doses.

The people planning to travel in the near future can visit the website ............. and check for a future date for travel to a particular destination, and the model will help them to know the countries that will reach herd immunity and will mark it as safe for travel.

The model will also be fine-tuned for NGOs to know which countries will need help in reaching the herd immunity by providing the details of the earliest date and year by which a particular country can be marked safe for travel. 

NGO's directed by WHO/UN can then send a team with vaccinations and mobile medical unit to vaccinate countries/state who will be ready for such assistance.




## Our Data 
- Data is being used from Our World in Data for all countries but firstly to test our model, we will be using 3 countries.

## Selected topic

-	Help travellers plan their next vacation by determining when countries will reach herd immunity based on their current vaccination rate. 

## Reason we selected the topic: 

-	COVID-19 has impacted many people around the world and many people are eager to travel. A major barrier to travelling right now is safety. Based on the current vaccination rates in each country we are going to determine when each country will reach herd immunity. Herd immunity is reached when approximately 70% of the population is fully vaccinated.

## Defining the problem we plan to solve.
-	When will countries reach herd immunity for safe travelling? 

## Project: Interactive website for Post COVID-19 Vacation Planner

-	Using JavaScript and HTML for front-end development, as well as Leaflet library and other tools to create visual representation of our data and results.

-	Users will be able to input information (e.g. Country they choose to travel to)

- 	Once the user has entered the departure and destination country, the website will generate when herd immunity will be reached in those countries in accordance with our machine learning model. 

-	The website will also generate a list of flights based on the departure/return date.

-	Users will be notified of travel advisories and whether it is safe to travel to that country. 

-	The user will be able to view further details of how herd immunity was calculate through a graph that reflects COVID-19 vaccination data (percentage of individuals that are fully vaccinated)
